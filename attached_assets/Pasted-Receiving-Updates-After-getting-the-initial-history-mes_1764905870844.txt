Receiving Updates
After getting the initial "history" messages, let's get real-time messages and updates.

Baileys exposes these updates via the event emitter as well.

Message events
messages.upsert
This event provides you with messages that you get either on offline sync or in real time.

The type of upsert is provided as either notify or append. Notify messages are usually the new messages, meanwhile append messages are everything else.

This event provides an array of proto.IMessages, so make sure to handle every item in the array.

Look into the Handling Messages page to handle the IMessage properly.

As an example:

sock.ev.on('messages.upsert', ({type, messages}) => {
  if (type == "notify") { // new messages
    for (const message of messages) {
      // messages is an array, do not just handle the first message, you will miss messages
    }
  } else { // old already seen / handled messages
    // handle them however you want to
  }
})

messages.update
Whether the message got edited, deleted or something else happened (change of receipt /ack state), a message update will be fired.

messages.delete
This event exists to declare the deletion of messages.

messages.reaction
Whether a reaction was added or removed to a message

message-receipt.update
This runs in groups and other contexts, where it tells you updates on who received/viewed/played messages.

Chat events
chats.upsert
This is triggered whenever a new chat is opened with you.

chats.update
This is triggered on every message (to change the unread count), and to put the latest message / latest message timestamp in the chat object.

chats.delete
This is triggered when the chat is deleted only.

blocklist.set
blocklist.update
Self-explanatory

call
Universal event for call data (accept/decline/offer/timeout etc.)

Contact events
contacts.upsert
Upon the addition of a new contact to the main device's address book

contacts.update
Upon the change of a saved contact's details

Group events
groups.upsert
When you are joined in a new group.

groups.update
