The times were propitious for a young institute bringing fresh thinking and scientific rigor to environmental and social challenges, and it grew rapidly. Over the years, we conducted 3,500 projects throughout the world, becoming an international leader in resource and environmental strategies and helping shape the embryonic field of sustainable development. 

Tellus has worked at every geographic level – global, regional, national, local, and enterprise – bringing both vision and analytic rigor to fashioning strategies, policies, and decision-support tools. Our projects have been distinguished by an integrated perspective in order to illuminate the important linkages across spatial scales and among environmental, social, and economic dimensions of development. Key foci have included energy, water, sustainable communities, corporate social responsibility, and climate change. The Institute's wide diversity of sponsors – foundations, government agencies, multilateral organizations, civil society organizations, and business – reflects the range of our program. Tellus has partnered with hundreds of organizations, most notably the Stockholm Environmental Institute with which we coordinated programs for nearly two decades. 

In 2005, Tellus entered a new phase, consolidating its programs to address the grand challenge of this century: a Great Transition to a sustainable, just, and livable global civilization. To attain this vision, the world must navigate toward ways of producing, consuming, and living that balance the rights of people today, future generations, and the wider community of life. The prospects for such a transition rest with the ascendance of new values, a planetary consciousness, and a sense of global citizenship. These aims will lie at the heart of the Institute's program of research, education, and network-building in the coming years.",tellus.org,1 to 10,linkedin.com/company/tellus-institute,Tellus Institute,"+16172665400, +16172665400122",Under 1 Million,,33441,Boston,MA,,Semiconductor Manufacturing,https://linkedin.com/in/cohnjonathan,,,,"valuation, financial modeling, investment banking, lbo, m&a experience, financial analysis",,2,JONATHAN COHN,12055 Wexford Club Dr,Roswell,GA,30075,,,C,Y,51,D7,E1,76.194.225.144,,,,,+12156302633

The University offers over 100 undergraduate and over 30 graduate-level (doctoral educational specialist, masters) major fields of study including specialized concentrations across six academic colleges. The University offers the Ph.D. in marine science: coastal and marine systems science, and the Ph.D. in education sciences.
 
A diverse population of more than 10,400 students from across the country and around the world engages with a world-class faculty, and they all enjoy an inspiring cultural calendar and a tradition of community interaction fueled by 183 student clubs, organizations and honor societies. Students learn, study and interact in high-quality facilities, including the HTC Student Recreation and Convocation Center, the Bryan Information Commons, and the Lib Jackson Student Union. 
 
The 17 Coastal Carolina athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA as members of the Sun Belt Conference. The University's mascot is the Chanticleer, a proud, fierce and quick-thinking rooster derived from Geoffrey Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales."" The football, softball and baseball teams all compete in the new TD Sports Complex, which houses Springs Brooks Baseball Stadium.
 
The University comprises 115 main buildings on 621 acres, including the Coastal Science Center and the Burroughs & Chapin Center for Marine and Wetland Studies on the East Campus, and the General James Hackler Golf Course, a public 18-hole golf facility adjacent to campus. The University also offers courses and events at several satellite locations along the Carolina coast. A 1,105-acre tract, including a portion of Waties Island, provides a natural laboratory for extensive study in marine science and wetlands biology on an Atlantic coast barrier island.

Providing state of the art veterinary hospitals, nurturing daycare, boarding, and grooming with an unmatched offering of amenities, the Wagly Pet Campus caters to pet parents' every need.

About Us:

Wagly is a family owned business that was started with the intention of bringing the very best in pet care services all under one roof. We believe in maintaining a high-level of care through all of our services. From daycare and boarding to grooming and our veterinary hospital, we treat your pet like family. 

Dogs are pack-driven animals, that's why we've designed our daycare program to socialize your pup and give them time to play under the watchful eye of our trained staff.

Our preventive care packages and on-staff veterinarians offer you the peace of mind that we are focused on keeping your pet healthy year round. This unique detail, coupled with our exclusive membership options are amenities that set Wagly apart.

Weaving state-of-the-art technology and a caring staff mean that expertise and affection are part of the prescription. Our pets are family, and at Wagly we understand the love and attention each one of them deserves. Centered on the well-being of the whole pet means a happier, healthier life for everyone!

We look forward to welcoming you to the Wagly family. 

Here's what our customers have had to say:
""These guys got my pup in the same day and he looked great coming out. I have a lab mix who has a thick undercoat. Jessica did an amazing job of removing excess fur and he's wonderfully soft and comfortable now. Jessica was just great and I'd give her five stars.""​ -Stephanie M.

""Do not hesitate. This was an amazing thing for my fur children. My 13-year-old cats have had baths at home but it always is such an ordeal. Tracy was quick in reply to my questions and scheduling. Then the service was outstanding.""​ - Sarah L.",wagly.com,251 to 500,linkedin.com/company/wagly,Wagly Veterinary Hospital & Pet Campus,+19497094600,Under 1 Million,,81,Tustin,CA,92780,Consumer Services,https://linkedin.com/in/dr-justin-michaels-o-d-a993a735,,,10-99,"animal husbandry, dental prophylaxis, dog training, veterinary, pets, anesthesia, surgery, soft tissue surgery, euthanasia, exotic animals, animal nutrition, veterinary public health, dogs, animal welfare, animal behavior, client education, parasitology, veterinary medicine",,4,JUSTIN MICHAELS,1480 Nicolas Way,Fullerton,CA,92833,,+17142734891,C,Y,47,T3,E1,,13942 Newport Ave,7149704200,https://nextdoor.com/pages/wagly-tustin-pet-campus-tustin-ca/,https://www.wagly.com/,+18137276248

Headquartered in metropolitan Washington, DC, the Meat Institute keeps its fingers on the pulse of legislation, regulation and media activity that impacts the meat and poultry industry and provides rapid updates and analyses to its members to help them stay informed. In addition, the Meat Institute conducts scientific research through its Foundation designed to help meat and poultry companies improve their plants and their products. The Institute's many meetings and educational seminars also provide excellent networking and information-sharing opportunities for members of the industry. 

The Meat Institute is governed by elected leaders and staffed by 25 professionals. The Meat Institute's elected leaders include three officers plus the President and CEO, as well as a 107-person Board of Directors and a 40-person Executive Board. Representatives on both of these bodies include leaders in both the supplier and packer/processor segments of the industry. The Meat Institute has also created operating groups, called policy committees and advisory committees, within its membership to allow member companies to recommend Meat Institute policies in their primary areas of interest. Policy committees focus on broad functional and operational areas and develop policy recommendations for specific issues within these areas.

The University of North Carolina System is a multi-campus university dedicated to serving the state of North Carolina and its people through world-class teaching, research and scholarship, and outreach and service. More than 225,000 students are enrolled in the UNC System's 16 university campuses across the state and the NC School of Science and Mathematics, the country's first public, residential high school for gifted students. 

The UNC System is one of the strongest and most successful systems of public higher education in the nation. It's mission—to discover, create, transmit, and apply knowledge to address the needs of individuals and society—remains true to the University's founding ideal of shared knowledge in a free society. In addition, the UNC System has a long-standing commitment to public service. The UNC Center for Public Television, the UNC Health Care System, the NC Arboretum, and other University affiliates and programs reap social and economic benefits for the citizens of the state. 

System Office
The UNC System Office, located in Raleigh, houses the offices of the president and senior administrative staff for the University. This core administrative staff executes the policies of the UNC Board of Governors and provides Systemwide leadership and support in the areas of academic affairs, business and financial management, communications, strategy and policy, human resources, legal affairs, and government relations. The UNC System Office also has administrative oversight of a number of University affiliates.",northcarolina.edu,10000+,linkedin.com/company/university-of-north-carolina,University of North Carolina System,+19199621000,Under 1 Million,"8011, 8062",6113,Raleigh,NC,,Higher Education,https://linkedin.com/in/kelly-holden-aa2905132,,,500+,"microsoft powerpoint, strategic planning, customer service, leadership, training",,6,KELLY HOLDEN,6006 Black Heath Dr,Fort Mill,SC,29707,,+19802542578,U,Y,47,T3,E1,,223 S West St,9196947244,https://nextdoor.com/pages/radius-realty-group-reiner-home-team-raleigh-nc/,http://www.reinerhometeam.com,+12144171163

We believe that traveling for pleasure has a redemptive power that enriches people's lives. And we believe that people should travel well.
Cruising on a Seabourn ship is unlike any other form of travel. The experience is luxurious, yet relaxed -- elegant, yet casual -- sumptuous, yet understated. Our intimate ships visit the most desirable destinations worldwide, sailing to the heart of landmark cities, as well as to hidden gems where larger vessels cannot follow.
Our ships attract interesting people, who seek to share experiences beyond the expected in places beyond the ordinary. Our acclaimed staff offers a unique style of heartfelt hospitality that is sincere, thoughtful and personal.

We have been fortunate to be consistently honored for our quality, service and value over the years, including the prestigious title of ""World's Best Small-Ship Cruise Line""​ by the readers of both Travel + Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler magazines. Cruise Critic named Seabourn ""Best for Luxury""​, and numerous other publications have recognized our luxurious accommodations, extraordinary level of service, exceptional dining, and unrivaled spa facilities.

This is why we're committed to sustainability, safety and a people-first mindset. 

Sustainability for Evergy means delivering clean, safe and reliable sources of energy today and into the future. We're embracing new energy sources to generate more power with less impact to our environment and adopting new technologies to help us be carbon neutral by 2045. More than half of the power we currently supply to our region comes from clean sources, creating more reliable energy with less impact to the environment.  

Evergy has a deep responsibility to safety and our company recognizes it is everyone's responsibility, always and in all situations. We never compromise on safety. 

When it comes to putting people first, we pour into our employees to foster an environment of inclusion and development. Evergy is an equal opportunity workplace and an affirmative action employer. We know that the more diverse, equitable and inclusive we are, the better we will be. To achieve our goals, we need an innovative, diverse and engaged workforce. With that strategy, we can achieve operational excellence. 

We have a mission to be the best energy company without compromising safety, sustainability and our commitment to our Kansas and Missouri communities. We move energy forward to empower a better future for all.",evergy.com,5001 to 10000,linkedin.com/company/evergyco,Evergy,"+18884715275, +18884715275112002",Under 1 Million,4911,,Kansas City,MO,64105,Utilities,https://linkedin.com/in/brandon-sack-2571921b,,,,,,6,BRANDON SACK,5201 Fox Chase Dr,Lawrence,KS,66049,,+17858458179,C,,49,T3,E1,,1201 Walnut St,8884715275,https://nextdoor.com/pages/kansas-city-power-light-co-kansas-city-mo/,http://www.evergy.com,+17857667391

We are not an ""aggregator"" - we are not looking for quick flips, or fleeting value. We are looking to partner with incredible, unique brands in order to help their communities create memories and connections for the next 20+ years.

We offer creative and emotional lifestyle products that help our customers create memories. Our customers spend their hard-earned dollars with us in order to break away from the normal 9 to 5 and we take that honor extremely seriously. Fundamental to that is building the highest quality, most creative product that truly delivers value to our customers.

There is a significant unmet medical for a simple test for determining who is at risk for developing severe preeclampsia due to the current low-confidence diagnosis of pregnant women presenting with preeclamptic symptoms.  Without such a test, there may be mistimed or unnecessary medical intervention, leading to rapid progression to severe disease and pregnancy/delivery complications.

We deliver an essential service to approximately 1.8 million residential and commercial customers to homes and businesses in Kansas and Missouri. Our electricity reaches about 4.5 million people, powering the most important life moments in the heart of our country. It's a responsibility that energizes our culture. 

This is why we're committed to sustainability, safety and a people-first mindset. 

Sustainability for Evergy means delivering clean, safe and reliable sources of energy today and into the future. We're embracing new energy sources to generate more power with less impact to our environment and adopting new technologies to help us be carbon neutral by 2045. More than half of the power we currently supply to our region comes from clean sources, creating more reliable energy with less impact to the environment.  

Evergy has a deep responsibility to safety and our company recognizes it is everyone's responsibility, always and in all situations. We never compromise on safety. 

When it comes to putting people first, we pour into our employees to foster an environment of inclusion and development. Evergy is an equal opportunity workplace and an affirmative action employer. We know that the more diverse, equitable and inclusive we are, the better we will be. To achieve our goals, we need an innovative, diverse and engaged workforce. With that strategy, we can achieve operational excellence.

When it was an independent company, its headquarters were in Mountain View, California.

Netscape's web browser was once dominant in terms of usage share, but lost most of that share to Internet Explorer during the so-called first browser war. The usage share of Netscape had fallen from over 90 percent in the mid-1990s to less than one percent by the end of 2006.

Netscape is credited with JavaScript, the most widely used language for client-side scripting of web pages, as well as developing the Secure Sockets Layer Protocol (SSL) for securing online communication, that was much used, before its successor TLS took over.

Netscape stock traded from 1995 until 1999 when it was acquired by AOL in a pooling-of-interests transaction ultimately worth US$10 billion. Shortly before its acquisition by AOL, Netscape released the source code for its browser and created the Mozilla Organization to coordinate future development of its product. The Mozilla Organization rewrote the entire browser's source code based on the Gecko rendering engine; all future Netscape releases were based on this rewritten code. The Gecko engine would later be used to power the Mozilla Foundation's Firefox browser.

Under AOL, Netscape's browser development continued until December 2007, when AOL announced that the company would stop supporting the Netscape browser as of early 2008. AOL has continued to use the Netscape brand in recent years to market a discount Internet service provider.",netscape.com,1001 to 5000,linkedin.com/company/netscape-communications,Netscape Communications,+18002904726,50 Million To 100 Million,"4899, 7374",,New York City,NY,10003,Information Technology & Services,,,,,,,5,PETER SCHEER,110 Piedmont Dr,Hurricane,WV,25526,,,B,Y,52,D7,E1,192.231.138.155,unknown,8665418233,https://www.angi.com/companylist/us/fl/jacksonville/netscape-reviews-2006892.htm,isp.netscape.com,+13044157318

The state of Sama promotes optimum physical and mental health, positive behavior and an expanded human-canine relationship. Our approach is inspired by the timeless holistic healing system of Ayurveda.

Sama (Sanskrit) = balance/equanimity
Ayurveda (Sanskrit) = the science/wisdom of life; living in tune with nature

Our vision is to inspire a culture of human companions who understand and implement a whole-being, soulful approach to promoting the wellbeing of dogs. Ultimately, the balance and wellbeing of dogs and their humans is a mutual experience.

We seek to deliver and scale results in the following arenas:

Equitable Economy: Promote economic inclusion and ownership to eliminate poverty, shrink inequality, and increase mobility.

Healthy Communities of Opportunity: Create and maintain opportunity-rich communities in all neighborhoods and all regions of the country through strong networks and social capital, equitable development, and infrastructure investments that enable low-income people and communities of color to thrive.

Just Society: Build power and expand agency to ensure that all systems and institutions are just, free of racial bias, and lead to a vibrant democracy where all, especially the most vulnerable, can participate and prosper.

We succeed by weaving together four essential functions:

Advocacy that advances policy change at all levels of government and across sectors.

Applied research and communications that build public and political will for inclusion, justice, and broadly shared prosperity.

Constituency and network engagement that empowers leaders to advance equity.

Implementation capacity that connects local innovations to policy; and provides stakeholders with needed data and tools.

Our work would not be possible without support from a broad array of people, organizations, and communities. Our mission is to advance racial and economic equity by Lifting Up What Works®.

Help achieve policies that can ensure equity for all by lending your support. Your contribution makes Lifting Up What Works® possible and enables us to disseminate our findings and provide strategic guidance to coalitions throughout the country. Help create communities of opportunity where everyone can participate and prosper.

At EAI, we take an integrated approach to impact. We know that transforming violent extremism cannot occur without strengthening community resilience and engaging all members of society. We know that barriers to girls'​ education will not be fully removed until we address gender norms. We know that youth marginalization cannot be curbed without job creation and access to leadership roles. We know that a strong democracy is founded on the pillars of social equity and justice, which require engaged civic leaders and responsive, accountable governments.

Kent's goal was to own not just a family restaurant and not just a steak restaurant, but a place where everyone, of all ages, could come and have a great meal and great fun for a great price.

We've got the great meal part down. In fact, we like to consider our food more than great. We think its Legendary. Hand-Cut Steaks, award-winning Fall-Off-The-Bone Ribs, Fresh-Baked Bread, and Made-From-Scratch Sides are the standard at Texas Roadhouse. 

We're more than just a steakhouse. We're a family restaurant. And, we believe our family is every member of every community that has a Texas Roadhouse.  We love being a part of our communities, which is why you're likely to see our Roadies and Andy the Armadillo out and about! 

Our legendary benefits include: medical, dental and vision insurance, 401(k) retirement plan, short and long-term disability coverage, life insurance, flexible spending accounts, paid vacation, stock incentive program, tuition reimbursement and best of all…GROWTH!

We love our workplace, and we love what we do. It's that love that shows up each and every night to engage, entertain, and excite our guests. And it's why we're so happy to invite you to bring your friends and family in for a great meal and a good time!

We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer.  We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, age, gender, gender identity, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, citizenship, national origin, or any other legally-protected status.
