# Noise suppression tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to enable noise suppression for the Voice API and TeXML calls.

Noise suppression works for both AI-powered calls (like AI Assistants and Gather Using AI) and regular voice calls. While it improves audio quality across all call types by reducing background noise, **the biggest value comes from enhanced AI performance**—cleaner audio leads to more accurate speech recognition and better AI responses. This makes noise suppression especially valuable for AI use cases where audio quality directly impacts user experience.

## Voice API

The noise suppression can be enabled for the Voice API calls in the following way:

<Callout type="info">
  *Don't forget to update `YOUR_API_KEY` here.*
</Callout>

The only parameter required for the request is `direction` which can have one of the following options: inbound | outbound | both.

Please be aware that the charge is applied for each direction separately.

```bash  theme={null}
    curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.telnyx.com/v2/calls/${call_control_id}/actions/suppression_start \
    --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "direction": "inbound"
    }'
```

The noise suppression can be stopped at any time in the following way:

```bash  theme={null}
    curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.telnyx.com/v2/calls/${call_control_id}/actions/suppression_stop \
    --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{}'
```

## TeXML

In TeXML there is a dedicated verb for enabling the noise suppression on the call.

```xml  theme={null}
<Response>
    <Start>
        <Suppression direction="inbound"/>
    </Start>
...
    <Stop>
        <Suppression/>
    </Stop>
</Response>
```
