About
The Marketplace API delivers data that helps users find and evaluate health care insurance plans, providers, and coverage information on the marketplace. It’s used by HealthCare.gov and other third party services. Request an API token here, or learn more from the developer site.

Retention
Marketplace API data includes at minimum the last three years of data.

Limitations
API keys are rate limited. This rate limit is passed along in the Header information provided. If you have concerns with the rate limit, please reach out to the Marketplace API team.

Quickstart
This section will cover a short workflow for a common scenario — looking up insurance plans for a person's household with premiums and estimated tax credits, obtaining details about a particular plan, and looking up the drug coverage for a specific plan. Other endpoints, like looking up doctors and providers, or getting recent state medicaid information, are covered in the docs.

Search for health insurance plans
We begin by searching for the health insurance plans for a 27 year-old woman living in North Carolina by posting a single person household to the plan search endpoint

apikey="d687412e7b53146b2631dc01974ad0a4" # rate limited test key
curl --request POST \\
  --url "https://marketplace.api.healthcare.gov/api/v1/plans/search?apikey=${apikey}" \\
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \\
  --data '{
    "household": {
      "income": 52000,
      "people": [
        {
          "age": 27,
          "aptc_eligible": true,
          "gender": "Female",
          "uses_tobacco": false
        }
      ]
    },
    "market": "Individual",
    "place": {
      "countyfips": "37057",
      "state": "NC",
      "zipcode": "27360"
    },
    "year": 2019
}'
This POST request returns health insurance information and pricing estimates for the plans for which she can sign up. More discussion about building the household JSON object can be found later on this page. Don't know the county FIPS code? To look it up for this person's zip code, we use the counties by zip endpoint.

apikey="d687412e7b53146b2631dc01974ad0a4"
zipcode="27360"
curl "https://marketplace.api.healthcare.gov/api/v1/counties/by/zip/${zipcode}?apikey=${apikey}"
This helps gather the necessary information to build the household object to submit to the API.

Get details about a specific health insurance plan
With a plan search completed, let's look more closely at a particular plan. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina Blue Value Catastrophic was one of the first returned from the example above. We will use it as an example to drill down

apikey="d687412e7b53146b2631dc01974ad0a4"
planid="11512NC0100031"
year="2019"
curl "https://marketplace.api.healthcare.gov/api/v1/plans/${planid}?year=${year}&apikey=${apikey}"
Using this endpoint will provide more granular information about the particular plan for a searching user, like issuer information, cost sharing deductibles, eligible dependents, website urls, quality ratings, and more.

Standard Plans
Some plans are considered standard plans. These can be identified in the results of a plan search or plan details endpoint. If a plan has a design_type that is one of the following, it is considered a standard plan: "DESIGN1", "DESIGN2", "DESIGN3", "DESIGN4", "DESIGN5". If a plan has a design_type of "NOT_APPLICABLE", then it is not considered a standard plan.

Get drug coverage information about a health insurance plan
Now that we have a plan of interest, let's look up what drugs it covers. We want to know if ibuprofen is covered under the insurance plan. First, we can mimic a user interaction with an autocomplete for ibuprofen for a typeahead.

apikey="d687412e7b53146b2631dc01974ad0a4"
query="ibuprof"
curl "https://marketplace.api.healthcare.gov/api/v1/drugs/autocomplete?q=${query}&apikey=${apikey}"
Among other things, this provides us with an RxCUI, a unique identifier for a clinical drug. We can use it along with the plan id to query the API for whether or not ibuprofen is covered under this plan

apikey="d687412e7b53146b2631dc01974ad0a4"
drugs="1049589"
planids="11512NC0100031"
year="2019"
curl "https://marketplace.api.healthcare.gov/api/v1/drugs/covered?year=${year}&drugs=${drugs}&planids=${planids}&apikey=${apikey}"
The API confirms that ibuprofen is covered.

More information about households
The household in the example above was sufficient to query Marketplace API, but there are more optional fields that can provide more accurate search results and premium estimates, or can be used by application developers to specify scenarios. For example, if a household does not live together, certain plans may no longer be eligible to them.

We begin with an example, describing what some of the less intuitive fields means. Here's the JSON of a fully filled in household, using all possible features

{
  "aptc_override": 288.61,
  "household": {
    "effective_date": "2019-05-01",
    "has_married_couple": true,
    "income": 52000,
    "unemployment_received": Adult,
    "people": [
      {
        "age": 27,
        "dob": "1992-01-01",
        "aptc_eligible": true,
        "does_not_cohabitate": false,
        "gender": "Female",
        "has_mec": false,
        "is_parent": false,
        "is_pregnant": false,
        "relationship": "Self",
        "uses_tobacco": false,
        "utilization": "Medium"
      },
      {
        "age": 25,
        "dob": "1994-03-03,
        "aptc_eligible": true,
        "does_not_cohabitate": false,
        "gender": "Male",
        "has_mec": false,
        "is_parent": false,
        "is_pregnant": false,
        "relationship": "Spouse",
        "uses_tobacco": false,
        "utilization": "Medium"
      }
    ]
  },
  "market": "Individual",
  "place": {
    "countyfips": "37057",
    "state": "NC",
    "zipcode": "27360"
  },
  "year": 2019
}
APTC Override
The aptc_override is an optional override to specify the Advanced Premium Tax Credit for a user, if the exact value is already known. For persons in the household, aptc_eligible denotes if the person is eligible for the Advanced Premium Tax Credit.

Unemployment Received
As part of the American Rescue Plan, if the household has received unemployment benefits during 2021 the household income must be capped to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level for the household size in APTC and CSR estimations. If the recipient is an adult tax payer, both ATPC and CSRs will be affected. If only a tax dependent received unemployment, the only effect will be to CSR eligibility.
If both an adult and dependent have received unemployment, "Adult" should be passed so that the maximum APTC and CSRs are received.
This field defaults to None if not included and only affects the 2021 market year.

Effective Date
This is the date a plan or coverage goes into effect and is used in premium calculations and determining eligibility. If omitted, the value defaults to the effective date of the plan, which is generally Jan 1 of the market year. The effective_date is required to correctly calculate the number of months since an individual has used tobacco. The number of months is the difference of the last tobacco use date until the effective_date. Considering the number of months since last tobacco use can impact the rate charged by a plan, this field is required to be included for a more accurate search result.

Age Calculation
Either an age or dob value must be provided. If age is provided that value is used in determining eligibility and premiums. If a dob is provided, a more accurate age is calculated using the combination of dob, the effective date, and plan specific rating-age adjustments. If both fields are populated, age takes precedence and no calculation will occur.

Plan rates can have age adjustments affecting what premiums get returned. Additionally, effective date in relation to age affects premium calculation and eligibility. Therefore, determining the correct age is important for accurate results.

Cohabitation
does_not_cohabitate indicates whether the person is living with the household.

Minimal Essential Coverage (MEC)
has_mec indicates whether a person has Medicaid/CHIP and may possibly not be included in the household for premium determination and insurance eligibility.

Relationship
relationship — which is not required to issue a request — is the relationship of a household member to the person applying for health insurance. For the main enrollee, the Self relationship is used.

Each plan on the marketplace defines a set of dependent relationships within a household as eligible to enroll in that plan.

If it is known by the caller what relationships exist within a household when making a request to Marketplace API, the API can more accurately determine household eligibility for plans. If the relationship field is used in a request, it must be a valid relationship for the provided market year (see list below).
When a household request is sent without relationships present in the household, Marketplace API will make as accurate an eligibility determinaton as possible without the relationship values.

The total set of dependent relationships that plans may use to restrict eligibility may change over the years. For 2020 and 2021, the possible relationship types that plans may utilize are as follows

2020	2021
Self	Self
Brother or Sister	Brother or Sister
Child	Child
Collateral Dependent	Collateral Dependent
Ex-Spouse	Ex-Spouse
Foster Child	Foster Child
Grandson or Granddaughter	Grandson or Granddaughter
Life Partner	Life Partner
Nephew or Niece	Nephew or Niece
Other Relationship	Other Relationship
Other Relative	Other Relative
Sponsored Dependent	Sponsored Dependent
Spouse	Spouse
Stepson or Stepdaughter	Stepson or Stepdaughter
Ward	Ward
Adopted Child
Annultant
Brother-in-Law or Sister-in-Law
Court Appointed Guardian
Dependent of a Minor Dependent
Guardian
Son-in-Law or Daughter-in-Law
Stepparent
As can be seen from this list, the list of potential relationships has been simplified between 2020 and 2021. When a relationship is not one of the obvious choices in this list, the fallback values of Other Relative and Other Relationship may be used.

Utilization
Finally, utilization is one of {"Low", "Medium", "High"} and is a description of how much a person intends to use their health insurance.

Bulk Data
Marketplace API offers various endpoints that offer bulk data. These endpoints will pass large JSON data sets through that are stored in s3. Currently these are only supported for the current and previous market years.

Understanding Errors
The Marketplace API returns standard HTTP status codes which indicate whether a specific HTTP request has successfully completed. For some errors, additional information is provided in the response body, including an application error code and a brief message.

HTTP Response Status Codes
Responses are grouped in five classes:

Successful responses (200–299)
