Act as a Senior Frontend Developer expert in UI/UX replication. I need you to replicate the attached UI design EXACTLY, pixel-perfect. Do not hallucinate styles. Do not simplify.

**Tech Stack:**
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS (Use arbitrary values if needed for exact precision)
- Lucide React (for icons)
- Google Fonts (Use 'Poppins' or 'Inter')

**Global Layout:**
- Full screen viewport (`h-screen`, `w-full`).
- Background: A dark, blurred background image (forest/nature theme) with a heavy dark overlay to match the reference.
- Main Component: A centered, floating 'Login/Signup' card. Large border-radius (approx `rounded-3xl`). White background on the left, Image background on the right. Shadow-2xl.

**Structure Breakdown (The Card):**
Use a CSS Grid or Flex row. Split: Left (40% width) - Right (60% width).

**LEFT PANEL (White Background):**
1.  **Header:**
    - Logo: "Trippel." (Blue sans-serif font). Icon: Blue gradient circle ring.
    - Title: "This is where incredible experiences start." (Black, Bold, Large text, approx 2.5rem).
    - Subtitle: "More than Thousand Locations for customized just for you..." (Gray-500, small text).
2.  **Social Login:**
    - Row of 3 circular buttons.
    - Twitter icon (black/dark outline).
    - Google icon (Solid Blue background #4285F4, white icon).
    - Twitch icon (black/dark outline).
3.  **Divider:** "Or" text with horizontal lines on both sides.
4.  **Form:**
    - Input: "Username" (Label inside or top, value "Jahan"). Border-gray-200, rounded-lg.
    - Input: "Email" (value "Amirh.jahangirr@gmail.com").
    - Input: "Password" (dots), with an "Eye" icon on the right.
5.  **CTA:**
    - Button: "Start Journey" (Full width, Black background, White text, rounded-lg, py-3).
6.  **Footer:**
    - Text: "Have an account? Login now!" ("Login now!" is blue).

**RIGHT PANEL (Image Background):**
- **Background:** High-quality image of a road going through a pine forest/mountain. Dark overlay gradient at the bottom for text readability.
- **Top Right Element (CRITICAL DETAIL):**
    - A white floating card positioned absolutely at the top right corner.
    - Text: "+89% Positive respond from people".
    - Button: "Start Now" (Black bg, white text).
    - *Shape nuance:* It has a reverse border-radius/cutout effect where it joins the main card. Replicate this visual anchoring.
- **Floating Watermark:** "Trippel." semi-transparent logo on the top right inside the image area.
- **Bottom Content:**
    - Headline: "We are a Family" (White, centered).
    - Subtext: "In camp we have a lot people with different life story..." (White, light opacity, centered).
- **Bottom Tags (The Pills):**
    - A row of 4 translucent pill-shaped glassmorphism buttons.
    - Styles: Dark/Glass background, white text, rounded-full.
    - Content:
        1. Orange circle icon + "# Trippel._Trip"
        2. Green circle icon + "# Trippel."
        3. Blue circle icon + "# Be_happy"
        4. Pink circle icon + "# Be_happy"

**Specific Constraints:**
- Use `backdrop-blur` where appropriate.
- Ensure inputs have proper padding (`px-4 py-3`).
- Replicate the font weights exactly (Bold headlines, medium buttons).
- Make sure the Right Panel image covers the full height and has `object-cover`.
